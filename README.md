# Cribbage Board I Can't Forget

## About This Project

This project is a digital Cribbage board created out of love and necessity. My wife and I have a cherished tradition of playing Cribbage on our anniversary. However, we often find ourselves in a predicament - we forget to bring our physical Cribbage board!

This digital Cribbage board is our solution to ensure that we never miss out on our anniversary game, no matter where we are or what we've forgotten to pack.

This project also serves as an example of using prompt driven development to build a project. Cursor was used to build out the code for the project.

## Features

- Add up to 6 players
- Keep track of scores for each player
- Highlight the current player
- Use keyboard arrows to navigate and score
- Celebrate the winner with a confetti animation
- Track the number of games won by each player
- Reset the game while maintaining player statistics

## How to Use

1. Add players by entering their names and clicking "Add Player" or pressing Enter.
2. Use the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust scores, or use the up and down arrow keys.
3. Navigate between players using the left and right arrow keys.
4. The first player to reach 121 points wins the game!
5. Click "New Game" to reset scores and start a new round.

## Why This Matters

This project is more than just a game - it's a way to keep our anniversary tradition alive, regardless of our forgetfulness or where we find ourselves celebrating. It's a testament to how technology can help preserve and enhance our personal traditions and connections.

## Technical Details

This project is built using React and TypeScript, with Vite as the build tool. It uses react-confetti for the winner celebration effect and includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest and React Testing Library.
